PA : Python Anywhere

'PA_final.py' is deployed and live on PythonAnywhere and it is working fine.

'PA_backtest_smtplib_mysql_4_7.py' is also tested on PythonAnywhere and working fine.

In above 2 files , I have used mysql as pythonanywhere dont provide postgres for free. 
So the code will not run in local. change db to postgres then it will work.




connection.py , utils.py , execute_4_7.py , backtest_with_db_4_7.py , final_backtest_4_7.py are also implementing the same logic
but with postgres db setup in local. (no email sending logic.)
final_backtest_4_7.py do not need db.
